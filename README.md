# Space-Invaders-Game-Project
Classic, old school game made in Java. 
Program made asa full stack project (back-end and interface made by me).
Interesting things connected with that program:
- Object oriented programming
- Simple user interface
- Program takes data from txt files in real time
- Usage of animations
- Control using mouse (menu) and keyboard (game)

It is highly recommended to try the game out!
